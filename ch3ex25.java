//Geometry: intersecting point)
/*
Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2,
y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).
The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following
linear equation:
(y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
(y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming Exercise
3.3).
Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting
point.
example:
Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4: 2 2 5 -1.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
The intersecting point is at (2.88889, 1.1111)
Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4: 2 2 7 6.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
The two lines are parallel
