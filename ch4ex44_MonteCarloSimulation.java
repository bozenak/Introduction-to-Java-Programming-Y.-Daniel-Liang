/*
A square is divided into four smaller regions. If you throw a dart
into square 1000 000 times, what is the probability of a dart to fall
into and odd-numbered region?
Write a program to simulate the process and display the results.

hint: Place center of the square in the center of coordinate system,
randomly generate a point in the square and count the number of times
for a point to fall into an odd-numbered region.
