//Science: day of the week
/*
Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by
Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week.
Write a program
that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and
displays the name of the day of the week.
example:
Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2015
Enter month: 1-12: 1
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 25
Day of the week is Sunday

Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2012
Enter month: 1-12: 5
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 12
Day of the week is Saturday

(Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need
to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to
the previous year.)
